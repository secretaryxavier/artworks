      <h2>Gilman Scholar Project: Neuroscience & Art in Italy</h2>
      <p>As a recipient of the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, I will be undertaking a research and cultural immersion project in Bologna, Italy. This project aims to explore the historical and contemporary intersections of art and neuroscience within the Italian academic and cultural landscape. Key activities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducting interviews with researchers at the University of Bologna.</li>
        <li>Visiting museums and archives to study anatomical illustrations and their influence on early neuroscience.</li>
        <li>Developing a comparative analysis of Italian and American approaches to public engagement with neuroscience.</li>
        <li>The Follow-On Service Project will involve creating a series of blog posts and a small digital exhibition to share findings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> [Specify Dates, e.g., Summer 2025 - Fall 2025]</p>
      <p><strong>Partners:</strong> [Specify if any, e.g., Department of Psychology, University of Bologna (Pending Confirmation)]</p>

      <h2>Honors Thesis Concepts (Anticipated Fall 2025 Start)</h2>
      <p>I am currently developing concepts for my undergraduate honors thesis in Psychology, focusing on cutting-edge topics in cognitive neuroscience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Active Inference & Phenomenal Consciousness:</strong> Investigating computational models of active inference as a framework for understanding the neural basis of subjective experience and self-awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>Neural Symbolism & Ritualistic Behavior:</strong> Exploring how the brain encodes symbolic meaning and how this relates to the cognitive and neural underpinnings of ritual practices across cultures.</li>
        <li><strong>Transcranial Photobiomodulation (tPBM) for Cognitive Enhancement:</strong> Reviewing existing literature and potentially proposing a study on the effects of tPBM (near-infrared light) on specific cognitive functions like working memory or executive function, and its implications for neuroaesthetics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Upcoming & Potential Collaborations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interviews in Bologna:</strong> Engaging with neuroscientists and art historians during my Gilman project (as mentioned above).</li>
        <li><strong>INA Science Officer Initiatives:</strong> Continuing to contribute to the Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Association at PSU, fostering student research and discussion. Potential projects include organizing a symposium on "Art & The Brain."</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Media & Cognitive Science Integration:</strong> Exploring opportunities to collaborate with PSU's digital media departments to create interactive experiences that visualize cognitive processes or neuroscience data.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Science Contributions:</strong> Seeking to contribute to open-source neuroscience tools or datasets.</li>
